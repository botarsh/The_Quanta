<pre><h4>PROBLEM (Why QUANTA)</h4></pre>
Being a woman in India ain't easy. Centuries of patriarchy have made women susceptible to 
a lot of dangers in society. Sure, things may have improved over time, but only so much.

Not a day goes by where you don’t hear of the news of a crime against women in India. 
It is extremely painful to watch the status of women’s safety in India, especially in a 
country where women are given the stature of goddesses. 

Furthermore, domestic violence and honor killings are very common. The wife stays in an abusive 
relationship because of the fear of society. The family kills their daughters in the name of honor 
to keep up with the reputation of their family. The list continues as crimes against women are on 
the rise rape, dowry deaths, trafficking and many more.
